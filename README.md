Titanic Classification Project

This project uses machine learning to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic based on features like age, gender, class, and more. 
The dataset is sourced from the famous Kaggle Titanic dataset.

Project Overview
The Titanic dataset contains information about 891 passengers, including their survival status. 

Data Cleaning:
Handling missing values in the Age and Embarked columns.
Dropping irrelevant or redundant features like PassengerId and Ticket.

EDA:
Visualizations to analyze survival rates based on features like gender, age, class, etc.

Feature Engineering:
Encoding categorical variables (e.g., Sex, Embarked).
Creating new features like FamilySize.

Model Building:
Training models such as Logistic Regression.
Comparing their performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.

Models and Results:

Model = Logistic Regression

Accuracy = 81%		
Precision  = 79%	 
Recall = 75%
